brewでインストールしたサービス、いつも`launchctl`使って、ググりながら

起動

    $ launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/xxx.plist

停止

    $ launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/xxx.plist


をやっていたけど、`brew service`コマンド使えばよかた・・


起動

    $ brew services start xxx

停止

    $ brew services stop xxx

その他

    $ brew services --help
    usage: [sudo] brew services [--help] <command> [<formula>]
    
    Small wrapper around `launchctl` for supported formulae, commands available:
       cleanup Get rid of stale services and unused plists
       list    List all services managed by `brew services`
       restart Gracefully restart selected service
       start   Start selected service
       stop    Stop selected service
    
    Options, sudo and paths:
    
      sudo   When run as root, operates on /Library/LaunchDaemons (run at boot!)
      Run at boot:  /Library/LaunchDaemons
      Run at login: /Users/maki/Library/LaunchAgents
