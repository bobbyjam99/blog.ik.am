OSSになったSwift。早速[HTTPサーバー](https://github.com/kylef/Curassow)ができていた。
Cloud FoundryのSwift用[buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/swift-buildpack)も出ていた。

Hello Worldアプリをデプロイしてみた
https://github.com/kylef/Curassow-example-helloworld

デプロイ先は[PWS](https://run.pivotal.io/)。

$ git clone https://github.com/kylef/Curassow-example-helloworld
$ cd Curassow-example-helloworld
$ cf push hello-swift -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/swift-buildpack -m 100m
